This code calculates and visualizes the trend and seasonal components of temperature data using moving averages. It defines two functions for computing moving averages (for odd and even data lengths) and functions to calculate the trend and seasonal variations. The temperature data is processed to extract these components, which are then printed and plotted. Finally, the trend and seasonality are displayed in separate subplots for visual analysis. Overall, it helps in understanding underlying patterns in time series data.
